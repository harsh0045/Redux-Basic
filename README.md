# 🔥 Redux Learning Path (Basic Implementation)

This repository demonstrates a **basic Redux setup** in a React application using a **single reducer file** for state management.

## 📚 What is Redux?
Redux is a predictable **state management** library that helps manage application state globally. It consists of:  
- **Actions** – Describe what changes in the state.  
- **Reducers** – Handle how the state updates based on actions.  
- **Store** – Holds the application state in one central place.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
- Set up a React app and install Redux and React-Redux.

### 2️⃣ Project Structure  
- The project follows a structured approach with separate files for store, reducer, and components.

## 📌 Redux Flow (Single Reducer Approach)

1. **Create a Store**  
   - The store holds the application's state and is connected to the reducer.  

2. **Define the Reducer**  
   - The reducer manages different states, such as a counter and authentication status.  

3. **Dispatch Actions**  
   - Actions are triggered from components to modify the global state.  

4. **Use Redux in React Components**  
   - Components access the state and dispatch actions using React-Redux hooks.  

5. **Connect Redux to React**  
   - The Redux store is provided to the entire application using the Provider component.

## 🛠 How to Run the App
- Start the development server and access the app in a browser.

## 💡 Why Use Redux?
✔ Centralized state management  
✔ Predictable updates with pure functions  
✔ Scalable and structured application architecture  
✔ Debugging with Redux DevTools
